        <h2>Hello I'm</h2>
        <h1>Faruk Md Safiullah</h1>
        <p>As-salamualaikum, I'm a beginner level web-developer. I've started the "Complete Web Development Course" at <a href="http://programming-hero.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming-hero.com</a> last month. But I've already mastered the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. I can create simple website with this basic knowledge. But when I'll finish my course, I'll become a world-class web-developer, insha-Allah. In the meantime, if you want to give me any simple project, don't hesitate to knock me at the link below.

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>After a long journey through my life, I've finally come to the right path. After searching a lot about web-development, I've realized that web-development is very interesting and it is like a game. And finally I've found my mentor in programming world! My past life is meaningless, nothing special that worth discussing. But when I'll finish my course at Programming-Hero, my life will be very special and interesting. 
                But if you want to know more about me, you are very welcome to my Facebook profile.</p>
